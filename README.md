# Toy Unstructured P2P System (PeerSim)

This project implements a toy unstructured peer-to-peer system using
gtk-gnutella. The system consists of five peers running locally with
keyword-based search and flooding-based routing.

## Workload
Option 1 (2.2): Fixed peers and shared files, varying number of queries
(10, 20, 40).

## Metrics
- Average query latency
- Query throughput
